# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Standalone Geospatial AR Viewer App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements for a standalone Geospatial Augmented Reality (AR) Viewer application. This application is being developed separately from the main AgentSphere application to specifically address and resolve core AR rendering, camera integration, and precise geospatial object placement issues. Once stable and functional, this standalone viewer will serve as the foundation or a linked component for the AR capabilities within the broader AgentSphere ecosystem.

## 2. Vision and Goals

### 2.1 Vision

To create a robust and reliable AR application capable of accurately displaying 3D objects at precise real-world geospatial coordinates, serving as a foundational technology for location-based AR experiences.

### 2.2 Goals

- **Validate Core AR Functionality:** Ensure seamless camera feed integration, stable AR session management, and accurate 3D object rendering.
- **Prove Geospatial Accuracy:** Confirm that objects deployed with precise location data (e.g., from GEODNET-corrected coordinates) are displayed correctly in AR at their intended real-world positions.
- **Troubleshoot & Debug:** Provide a focused environment to identify and resolve issues related to WebXR, camera access, and object placement without interference from other application features.
- **Establish Best Practices:** Develop a modular and well-structured AR component that can be easily integrated or linked into the main AgentSphere application.

## 3. Target Audience

### 3.1 Primary Users

- **Developers & Testers:** Individuals working on the AgentSphere project who need to verify AR functionality.
- **Early Adopters/Beta Testers:** Users who will help test the core AR experience in real-world environments.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 AR Scene Initialization & Management

- **Camera Feed Integration:** Display the live camera feed as the background for the AR experience.
- **AR Session Control:** Robust initialization and management of the AR session (e.g., WebXR).
- **Permission Handling:** Clear prompts for camera permissions and graceful handling of permission denials.

### 4.2 Geospatial Location Integration

- **Precise User Location:** Obtain the user's current precise location (latitude, longitude, altitude) by calling the existing `/api/get-precise-location` backend endpoint (from the main AgentSphere project).
- **Location Updates:** Continuously update the user's location to ensure accurate object rendering as the user moves.

### 4.3 Object Retrieval & Rendering

- **Supabase Integration:** Connect to the Supabase database (from the main AgentSphere project) to retrieve `deployed_objects`.
- **Proximity-Based Loading:** Query and load 3D objects from the `deployed_objects` table that are within a defined radius (e.g., 50-100 meters) of the user's precise location.
- **3D Model Rendering:** Render simple 3D models (e.g., cubes, spheres, or basic GLTF models) in the AR scene at their respective geospatial coordinates.
- **Object Scaling & Orientation:** Ensure 3D models are appropriately scaled and oriented within the AR environment.

### 4.4 User Interface (Minimal)

- **AR View:** The primary display is the live camera feed with overlaid 3D objects.
- **Status Indicators:** Display messages for loading, camera status, location acquisition, and object discovery (e.g., "Searching for objects...", "Found 5 objects nearby.").
- **Exit Button:** A button to exit the AR view.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The AR experience must be smooth and responsive, with a high frame rate.
- **Stability:** The application should be stable and not crash during AR sessions.
- **Security:** Securely handle user location data and Supabase credentials.

## 6. Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **AR Framework:** A-Frame or Three.js with AR.js
- **Camera Integration:** expo-camera
- **Location Services:** expo-location
- **Styling:** StyleSheet (React Native)
- **Backend Integration:** Connect to existing Supabase database
- **Icons:** Lucide React Native

## 7. Success Metrics

- **Successful Camera Integration:** The live camera feed is consistently displayed as the AR background.
- **Accurate Object Placement:** 3D objects are rendered at their correct geospatial coordinates.
- **Stable AR Sessions:** The AR experience is stable and does not crash.
- **Successful Supabase Integration:** Objects are correctly retrieved from the `deployed_objects` table.

## 8. Assumptions & Constraints

- **Modern Mobile Devices:** Users will have access to modern smartphones with AR capabilities.
- **Internet Connectivity:** Stable internet access is required for location services and Supabase integration.
- **Expo Managed Workflow:** The application will be developed using Expo managed workflow exclusively.
- **Web Platform Primary:** Default platform is Web with mobile compatibility.

## 9. Out of Scope

- Complex 3D model animations
- Multi-user AR experiences
- Advanced AR features like occlusion or lighting
- Integration with social media platforms
- Monetization features
